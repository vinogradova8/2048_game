<h4>This project is game 2048.</h4>

In this game, the player must combine cells containing the same numbers until they reach the number 2048. The cells can contain only integer values starting from 2, and that are a power of two, like 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on.

The board has dimension of 4 x 4 cells, so that it can fit up to 16 cells. If the board is full, and there is no possible move to make like merging cells together - the game is over.
